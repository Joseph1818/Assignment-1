This README contains basic instructions for compiling and running React applications. Before proceeding, ensure that Node.js and npm have been set up on your workstation.

Step 1 : Installation
#Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Joseph1818/Assignment-1.git

#Change into the project directory:

cd your-react-app

#Install the project dependencies:

npm install

Step 2 : Getting started
#Start the development server:

npm start
This opens the application in your usual web browser. You can access it via http://localhost:3000.

Step 3: Project Structure
The project structure follows a standard React application setup. Key directories include:

src: Contains the source code of the React application.

public: Contains static files that do not need to go through the build process.

step 4: Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start: Runs the app in development mode.

npm test: Launches the test runner.

npm run build: Builds the app for production.
